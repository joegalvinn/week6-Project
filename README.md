Hello, here are some sepcific links that i was using:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-localstorage-with-react-hooks-to-set-and-get-items/ <- local storage
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43206423/css3-tranisition-box-shadow-pulse <- pulse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE4MsGlzxxc <- flip

also used w3school, developer.mozilla, stackoverflow, reddit, tutorialrepublic, youtube to help. 

I think i understand what i'm doing but i'm also just following along previous lessons and things i find online, i don't think i could do this if someone just said "okay write this code" i wouldn't know where to start. i Understand this isn't expected to be known but i feel like i should know more than i do?

I found a card flip tutorial online that i wanted to use for my upgrades however I couldnt get it to work, either all the upgrades were bound to one flipping card or i managed to put images on the fronts individually but they wouldnt flip etc etc.

I do think react makes sense more logically and easily than plain js but its a lot to take in in a week.

Lastly I also found render to be a pain. my code worked fine locally but when deployed i had a load of pathing errors that took me serveral hours to figure out. I dont think i did them any differently to how shown in class, would this be something that could be gone over in a lesson? thanks
